         <h2>Commentary</h2>
         <p>The idea forwarded by Schweyer in 297 that the text was not meant to be read by humans
            but only by the goddess who was recipient of the donation, and that this would explain
            why the text was engraved upside-down on the object which is interpreted as a bowl,
            seems entirely <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ad hoc</i></span>.</p>
         <p>For the opening phraseology, cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 5</a>, ll. 17-18. Might the unique expression <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>rājabhagavanta</i></span> be equivalent to <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>yuvarāja</i></span>? It seems more likely that this expression is intended as a compound, than as two
            separate words, as previous editions have assumed. The name Sakrānta is possibly attested
            again, although with orthographic variants, as <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>sakram̃ttha</i></span> in <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 1</a> and as <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>sakram̃tthi</i></span> in <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 43</a>.</p>

         <p>An initial reading having been presented during a lecture at Paris (), the text was
            read directly from the original by father Durand, and published again with a different
            reading of the date in 291 n.&nbsp;2, whence 188; the reading of the date was again emended
            in 192; reading with new error for the date in 107 (see also the entry by the same
            author in ); an emendation proposed in 476</p>
