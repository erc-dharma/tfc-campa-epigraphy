         <p> I. The power (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śakti</i></span>) of [his] rival destroys no enemy, even when it is brought near by the fear of (political
            manoeuvres such as) punishment or sowing of dissension.&nbsp;— But the one whose dauntless
            [spear (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śakti</i></span>)], like that of the spear-wielder [Skanda himself], destroys every enemy without
            its shaft ever breaking (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>adaṇḍabhedā</i></span>), — But the one whose [mere] gesture of protection (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>abhī</i></span>), without need of resorting to [the political manoeuvres of] punishment or the sowing
            of dissension, has brought low every enemy, as though he were in fact holding a spear
            (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śaktibhr̥ta iva</i></span>), — But the one who is like Skanda and for whom [the power (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śakti</i></span>) of Śiva, in initiation (cf.&nbsp;the term <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śaktipāta</i></span>)], arousing no fear and resorting to neither punishment nor sowing of dissension,
            has broken every [internal] enemy, </p>
         <p>II. namely the king Śrī Prakāśadharman, has installed this pair of footprints in order
            to praise king Kandarpadharman, the father of his paternal great-grandmother. </p>

         <h2>Commentary</h2>
         <p>We assume three levels of punning (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śleṣa</i></span>) in the first stanza. The first two play on the possibility of taking <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śaktibhr̥t</i></span> either literally, or as epithet of the war-god Skanda; on the possibility of interpreting
            <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>abhī</i></span> in two different ways; and on the different possibilities of analyzing the compound
            <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>adaṇḍabhedā</i></span>. The third sense may be less obvious to most readers. But in a footnote in the Preface
            to his edition of the Parākhyatantrap.&nbsp;xix, n.&nbsp;17 has discussed Śaiva punning on the
            words <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śakti</i></span> (spear or power, of king, Skanda or Śiva) and <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ari</i></span> (enemies, worldly or internal) in a late-7th-century inscription of Pallava king
            Narasiṁha II. He has there provided textual references in support of taking <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>arivarga</i></span> ‘group of enemies’ as denoting the human senses or passions (a theme also alluded
            to in <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 173</a>), and referred to a passage illustrating the (descent of) divine power (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śaktipāta</i></span>) as crucial element in Śaiva tantric initiation.&nbsp; </p>
         <p>In further support of the assumption of this third sense, he has shared with us his
            interpretation of a stanza in a somewhat later inscription.&nbsp;This is K. 528 (Eastern
            Mebon, 953 CE, edited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/befeo.1925.3058">Finot 1925</a>: pages 309–352), stanza XX, about King Rājendravarman, and it comprises three crucial
            elements that we also see in ours: 
            <div class="translated-verse">āsādya <b>śaktiṁ</b> vivudhopanītāṁ māheśvarīṁ jñānamayīm amoghām</div>
            <div class="translated-verse"><b>kumāra</b>bhāve vijit<b>āri</b>varggo yo dīpayām āsa mahendralakṣmīm ||</div>
            <p class="ab">‘After attaining the Power (or: weapon) of Maheśvara (Śiva) that consists in Knowledge,
               that is never failing (viz. after attaining initiation) [and that has been] transmitted
               by the gods, being in youth (or: as crown-prince, or: as Kumāra, i.e. Skanda) one
               whose enemies (or: passions) were conquered, he caused the glory of Mahendravarman
               to shine.’</p> Mahendra is both the name of King Rājendravarman’s father, Mahendravarman, and a
            name of the god Indra, whose enemies Skanda destroyed. So there must here be a reference
            to Skanda getting hold of (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>āsādya</i></span>) his famous weapon, called Śakti (though not always clearly a spear), and destroying
            Indra’s enemies (which was the reason for his birth being plotted by Indra in the
            first place). Most words can be accounted for in that layer of meaning, but the words
            <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>māheśvarīṁ jñānamayīm</i></span> defy multivalent interpretation, and <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vibudhopanītāṁ</i></span> suggests that he gained his famous weapon from the gods. There is almost certainly
            a myth that recounts such a handover, but we have not been able to find it. What we
            do find is that Viśvakarman is said to have fashioned Guha’s Śakti using bits of radiance
            of the sun (in <span class="italic">Viṣṇupurāṇa</span> 3.2.12), and that certainly suggests that some god must then have handed it to him.
            What is plain is that in one level of meaning the verse refers to Rājendravarman,
            like Prakāśadharman, having received Śiva’s salvific grace (<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>śakti</i></span>), in other words tantric initiation.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Our new reading <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>svapitāmahīpitur</i></span> makes Kandarpadharman the father of Prakāśadharman’s paternal grandmother (rather
            than the father of his paternal great-grandmother).</p>
