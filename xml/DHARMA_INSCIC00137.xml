<note>Although Huber (who used the same estampage as we do) marked no uncertainty of reading, no trace is visible of the subscript <foreign>r</foreign> under the consonant that he reads as <foreign>p</foreign>. This consonant must, however, quite certainly be read as <foreign>s</foreign>, for it shows the distinctive diagonal bridge between the two verticals.

               <foreign>abhī</foreign> in two different ways; and on the different possibilities of analyzing the
               compound <foreign>adaṇḍabhedā</foreign>. The third sense may be less obvious to most
               readers. But in a footnote in the Preface to his edition of the
                  <bibl><ref target="cic-bibl:goodall-2004"><title>Parākhyatantra</title></ref><citedRange unit="page">p. xix, n. 17</citedRange></bibl> has discussed Śaiva

                  <foreign>ari</foreign> (enemies, worldly or internal) in a late-7th-century
               inscription of Pallava king <persName type="king">Narasiṁha II</persName>. He has
               there provided textual references in support of taking <foreign>arivarga</foreign>
               ‘group of enemies’ as denoting the human senses or passions (a theme also alluded to in <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIC00173.xml">C. 173</ref>), and referred to a passage
               illustrating the (descent of) divine power (<foreign>śaktipāta</foreign>) as crucial element in Śaiva tantric initiation.
            </p><p>In further support of the assumption of this third sense, he has shared with us his
               interpretation of a stanza in a somewhat later inscription. This is K. 528 (Eastern

               three crucial elements that we also see in ours:

                Mahendra is both the name of King Rājendravarman's father, Mahendravarman, and a name of the god Indra, whose enemies Skanda destroyed.  So there must here be a reference to Skanda getting hold of (<foreign>āsādya</foreign>) his famous weapon, called Śakti (though not always clearly a spear), and destroying Indra's enemies (which was the reason for his birth being plotted by Indra in the first place).  Most words can be accounted for in that layer of meaning, but the words <foreign>māheśvarīṁ jñānamayīm</foreign> defy multivalent interpretation, and <foreign>vibudhopanītāṁ</foreign> suggests that he gained his famous weapon from the gods. There is almost certainly a myth that recounts such a handover, but we have not been able to find it.  What we do find is that Viśvakarman is said to have fashioned Guha's Śakti using bits of radiance of the sun (in <title>Viṣṇupurāṇa</title>  <seg type="check">3.2.12</seg>),
                  <!-- AG how to deal with primary sources in bibliography? -->
                  and that certainly suggests that some god must then have handed it to him. What is plain is that in one level of meaning the verse refers to Rājendravarman, like Prakāśadharman, having received Śiva’s salvific grace (<foreign>śakti</foreign>), in other words tantric initiation. </p><p>Our new reading <foreign>s<supplied reason="lost">v</supplied>apitāmahīpitur</foreign> makes Kandarpadharman the father of Prakāśadharman’s paternal grandmother (rather than the father of his paternal great-grandmother).</p></div>
