         <h2>Commentary</h2>
         <p>The iconography of what remains of the sculpture seems somewhat comparable with that
            seen in the sculpture whose back bears the inscription <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 42</a> from Drang Lai, which dates to the same period, although the posture of the deity
            sitting on the bull is different in both cases. Another inscription that has come
            to light in recent years (<a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 215</a>) is engraved on the back of the upper part of a broken statue of Śiva. The god’s
            mount and head are here not preserved, but what is preserved of the torso is very
            comparable to the Śiva from Drang Lai, bearing on its back <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 42</a>, and so the torso may be considered to have been a Śiva. Moreover, this fragment
            of a Śiva was found at the site of Chùa Vua (or Gò Lồi) in the valley Chiêm Sơn Tây
            (Chiêm Sơn West) near Trà Kiệu.</p>
         <p>In other words, we have two contemporary fragments of inscriptions, one engraved on
            the upper back, the other on the lower back of a sculpture, both of these fragments
            found in Chiêm Sơn; the one fragment shows the torso of a possible Śiva, the other
            the lap of a deity sitting on a bull, i.e. almost certainly Śiva. We are very tempted
            to consider that these two inscriptions, <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 215</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy"></a>, originally belonged together as top and bottom. The measurements of the stones would
            seem to allow this hypothesis, although both fragments have suffered a lot precisely
            in the place where the pieces would have been joined, so it is hard to get any certainty
            from measurement, and it is not likely that physically trying to join the two pieces
            would yield clear confirmation either. We have measured the size of the letters of
            the two inscriptions, and the result was some dissimilarity in size, so that we remain
            in doubt about this hypothesis.</p>
         <p>The final words of this inscription show the same formula with which the inscription
            <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfc-campa-epigraphy">C. 42</a> is also terminated.</p>  </div>
